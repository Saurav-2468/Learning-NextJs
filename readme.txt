Routing

Routing Conventions

-All routes must be placed inside the app folder
-Every file that corresponds to a route must be named page.js or page.tsx
-Every folder corresponds to a path segment in the browser URL

File Based Routing


Nested routes
http://localhost:3000/blog/second

make blog inside app.tsx
make second folder inside blog folder and define page.tsx
